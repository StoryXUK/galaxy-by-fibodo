                                <p>7.1 We offer plans for Providers to
                                    provide services through the Site.
                                    Details about plans can be found on the
                                    Site at: <a href="https://core.fibodo.com"

                                <p>7.2 If a Provider purchases a
                                    subscription package then this will
                                    automatically renew on a monthly or
                                    annual basis until the Provider notifies
                                    us of its intent to terminate such
                                    subscription, such termination to take
                                    effect immediately.</p>
                                <p>7.3 The Provider shall be entitled to
                                    upgrade its subscription payment at any
                                    time, subject to the payment of any
                                    additional upgrade fees. In the event
                                    that a Provider wishes to upgrade a
                                    subscription package, such upgrade shall
                                    be effective immediately, the balance
                                    will be due immediately and the revised
                                    monthly payment amount will be taken at
                                    the next payment date.</p>
                                <p>7.4 In the event that a Provider wishes
                                    to change their subscription package
                                    (e.g. to upgrade), this will be
                                    effective immediately and a new monthly
                                    subscription payment date will be
                                    established.</p>
                                <p>7.5 Where a Provider registers to use the
                                    Site by any of the methods set out
                                    above, the Provider agrees to disclose

                                    account registration process, and to
                                    update Provider information promptly in
                                    the event that it changes. Providers
                                    agree not to select a username which is
                                    offensive, misleading or otherwise
                                    inappropriate.</p>
                                <p>7.6 Providers agree that we may remove

                                <p>8.1 Once Provider Services have been posted, the applicable Provider will receive
                                    notification once a User books such Provider Services. We will notify the User on
                                    screen and/or by push notification via text or email (provided that a valid email
                                    address is supplied) confirming the booking confirmation for the Provider Services.
                                    This represents a confirmation that the Provider Services have been booked (a
                                    Booking Confirmation).</p>
                                <p>8.2 At the point a User receives the Booking Confirmation, payment will be taken from
                                    the User.</p>

                                <h5>9. Prices and Payment</h5>
                                <p>9.1 We may change the user payment methods that we accept at our sole discretion at
                                    any time without notice.</p>
                                <p>9.2 Provider Services may be made available at either standard or discounted rates,
                                    as specified on the Site, when listing a Provider Service, provided that the rates
                                    specified in clauses 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 are not inconsistent with the
                                    <strong>fibodo</strong> payment administration guidelines set out at Schedule 1
                                    and/or the Site:

                                    <li>9.2.1 <strong>Package Rates:</strong> Package bookings may be discounted as set
                                        out on the Site when listing the Provider Services(s). Package rates will only
                                        be offered where expressly selected when listing a Provider Service. For
                                        example, if a package of Provider Services is offered then rates may be
                                        expressed as “X for the price of Y” (e.g. “4 for 3”) meaning that the package is
                                        priced below the cost of X number of Provider Services if booked individually.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>9.2.2 <strong>Discounted Services:</strong> Discounted rates will only be
                                        offered where expressly selected when listing the Provider Services. For
                                        example, discounted rates may be offered where a User books a Provider Service
                                        at short notice prior to the relevant Provider Service. Provider Services may be
                                        discounted as set out on the Site when listing the Provider Service.</li>
                                    <li>9.2.3 <strong>Standard:</strong> Standard rates will apply where Package or

                                <p>9.3 If a booking is made directly with a User (Direct booking), the Provider must
                                    clearly inform the User that the booking is made outside of the remit of
                                    <strong>fibodo</strong> and that all requests for refunds or other administration
                                    must be handled directly by the Provider.

                                <p>9.4 Prices stated on our Site shall be inclusive of our commission which, for the

                                <p>9.5 Providers agree not to market Provider Services, or any services substantially
                                    similar to the Provider Services, on any third-party booking management platform

                                    ‘MarketPlace’ network of partners. Bookings made through these channels will be

                                <p>10.5 If the User transpires not to be the authorised user of the payment card used or
                                    if the User otherwise contests the transaction as fraudulent, the amount of a
                                    transaction may be reversed or charged back (Chargebacks). For any transaction that
                                    results in a Chargeback, <strong>fibodo</strong> may withhold the Chargeback amount
                                    in a reserve or may recoup from the Provider the amount of the Chargeback together
                                    with any associated fees, fines and a <strong>fibodo</strong> service charge of
                                    £50.00. If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payments and if we reasonably
                                    believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold
                                    the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you until such
                                    time as: (a) the Chargeback is assessed due to a User complaint, in which case we
                                    will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by
                                    which the User may dispute the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a
                                    Chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds
                                    related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you agree to pay us the full
                                    amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and
                                    expenses, including lawyers’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by us for the
                                    collection of all amounts unpaid by you.</p>
                                <p>10.6 If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive amount of
                                    Chargebacks, we may establish additional conditions governing your account,
                                    including (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a reserve in an amount
                                    reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees, (c)
                                    delaying pay-outs, or (d) terminating or suspending your use of the Site.</p>
                                <p>10.7 Providers agree to assist us when requested, at your expense, with
                                    investigations into any of your transactions processed through the Site. To that
                                    end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the User, the User's
                                    financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or
                                    mediate a Chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the
                                    Chargeback. If the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release
                                    corresponding reserved funds to your account. If a Chargeback dispute is not
                                    resolved in your favour by the network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest
                                    the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as
                                    described in these terms. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely
                                    manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation
                                    within fifteen (15) days of our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback.
                                    We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or
                                    investigating Chargeback disputes.</p>
